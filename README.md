  * Acclaimed for the scholarship of its prominent authors and the clarity of its narrative, AMERICAN GOVERNMENT: INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES sets the standard for public policy coverage while maintaining focus on three fundamental topics: the importance of institutions of American government; the historical development of governmental procedures, actors, and policies; and who governs in the United States and to what ends. Student involvement in the material is bolstered by proven pedagogical features such as learning objectives framing each chapter, ""Constitutional Connections"" relating current issues to founding principles, and ""How Things Work"" boxes that illustrate important concepts.
